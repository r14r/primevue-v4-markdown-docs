Theme Designer is a tool build on top of this theming api with important features to make theming easier. Designer consists of 4 key features; The <b>visual editor</b> provides a UI to edit the complete set of tokens. The <b>figma to code</b> generator is extremely useful to automate the design to code process and integrates seamlessly with the Figma UI Kit. The themes are saved in the <b>cloud storage </b>to be accessible from anywhere and any device and finally the <b>migration assistant</b> automatically updates your themes to the latest library version. </p><!--]--></div><!--]--></section><section class="py-6"><!--[--><h2 class="doc-section-label">License <!-- --></h2><div class="doc-section-description"><!--[--><p> A license key is required to be able to use all the services provided by the designer. Without a license, the visual editor is still available for trial purposes with various options such as downloads, and cloud storage disabled. The license key can be purchased at <a href="https://primefaces.org/store/designer.xhtml">PrimeStore</a>, it is valid for 1 year and needs to be renewed manually after a year. </p><!--]--></div><!--]--></section><section class="py-6"><!--[--><!--[--><h2 class="doc-section-label">Dashboard <!-- --></h2><div class="doc-section-description"><!--[--><p> Dashboard is the entry point of the designer.

The mapping is created via the <a href="https://tokens.studio/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Token Studio</a> at Figma which allows exporting a single json file. The Designer is able to interpret this file and transform it to an actual theme. In case your UI Kit version is older, the transformation process marks the missing tokens and recommends an auto migration via the migration assistant. This is an automated workflow and eliminates the manual design to code during the handoff process. If you have UI designers in your team, the recommended approach is using Figma for the actual design process and utilizing the designer for transformation, preview and download purposes. </p><b class="mb-4 block">Export JSON file</b><p> Open the <a class="" href="https://primevue.org/uikit">PrimeOne UI Kit</a> in which you've modified tokens. In the Tokens Studio plugin, navigate to the <i>Tools</i> menu and select <i>Export to file/folder.</i> When the Export tokens modal appears, make sure the <i>Single file</i> tab is selected.

A design token requires a name and a value where the value can be a static value like a color or another token. The name of the token should be a dot seperated lowercase value e.g. <i>accent.color</i>. For example, a custom token name can be defined as <i>accent.color</i> and the value can either be a value like <i>#eab308</i> or another token such as <i>{yellow.50}</i>. Custom tokens can also refer to each other, e.g. <i>selection.background</i> custom token can define <i>{accent.color}</i> as a value. </p><p>If you have created a theme from Figma, use the name <b>custom</b> as the name of your token set group. This keyword is special since the import tool will populate the custom tokens using this set in tokens json file.</p><!--]--></div><!--]--><!--[--><h3 class="doc-section-label">Intelligent Completion <!-- --><a aria-current="page" class="router-link-active router-link-exact-active" href="https://primevue.org/designer/guide/#autocomplete" id="autocomplete"> # </a></h3><div class="doc-section-description"><!--[--><p> The editor is packed with features for improved user experience.

New tokens are likely to be added with each major release, in order to keep your themes up to date the migration assistant is available featuring automated migration. The <b>Check for Updates</b> option initially scans a theme for any missing tokens. This tool does not override the values of existing tokens, and only adds missing tokens if necessary. Still, it is recommended to duplicate your theme as a backup and run a preview before the migration. Depending on the result, you may choose to proceed with the migration process. In case there are missing tokens, your theme would receive them with placeholder values so it is recommended to take a note of them before migration and then visit the components to replace the placeholder values with actual values of your choice. These types of newly added tokens would be highlighed in Editor. </p><div class="px-8 pt-8 bg-surface-0 dark:bg-surface-900 rounded-2xl border border-surface" style="max-width:48rem;"><img alt="Designer Dashboard" class="w-full" src="https://primefaces.org/cdn/designer/guide-migration.png"/></div><!--]--></div><!--]--></section><section class="py-6"><!--[--><h2 class="doc-section-label">Limitations <!-- --></h2><div class="doc-section-description"><!--[--><p>Current known technical limitations are listed at this section.</p><ul class="leading-relaxed list-inside list-disc"><li>The border width token in Figma does not support multiple values, related <a class="doc-link" href="https://github.com/tokens-studio/figma-plugin/issues/3237" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issue</a>.</li></ul><!--]--></div><!--]--></section><!--]--></div>
