# PrimeVue v4 Markdown Documentation

This repository is a fork of [navidb/primevue-v4-markdown-docs](https://github.com/navidb/primevue-v4-markdown-docs) and contains a consolidated version of the PrimeVue v4 documentation in a single Markdown file. It was generated by scraping the official PrimeVue documentation website using the included Python script.

We added the functionality. that for all code samples in the documentation, this code is saved as *.vue files.

**Purpose:**

*   Provide offline access to the documentation.
*   Enable easier searching across the entire documentation.
*   Serve as a potential data source for training Large Language Models (LLMs) on PrimeVue v4.

**Disclaimer:** This is an **unofficial** resource generated through web scraping. While efforts were made to capture the main content accurately, there might be minor formatting inconsistencies or missing elements (like interactive examples or images). The content's accuracy depends on the official documentation at the time of scraping. For the most up-to-date and official information, always refer to the <a href="https://primevue.org/" target="_blank">Official PrimeVue Documentation</a>.

## Contents

*   `primevue_v4_docs.md`: The consolidated documentation in Markdown format.
*   `scrape_primevue.py`: The Python script used to scrape the website and generate the Markdown file.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python libraries required to run the script.
*   `LICENSE`: MIT License file.
*   `.gitignore`: Standard Python gitignore file.

## Using the Scraper Script

If you want to regenerate the documentation yourself (e.g., after the official docs are updated):

1.  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/navidb/primevue-v4-markdown-docs.git
    cd primevue-v4-markdown-docs
    ```
3.  **Set up a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python scrape_primevue.py <STARTING_URL> <OUTPUT_FILENAME.md>
    # Example:
    python scrape_primevue.py https://primevue.org/introduction/ primevue_v4_docs_latest.md
    ```

## Notes

*   The script currently attempts to find content within `div.doc-main` or `div.doc` elements.
*   It skips certain pages (like Roadmap, Templates, etc.) that had significantly different structures or caused SSL issues during the initial run. You can modify the `SKIPPED_URLS` set in the script if needed.
*   Images and the right-hand page navigation (`ul.doc-section-nav`) are intentionally excluded from the Markdown output.
